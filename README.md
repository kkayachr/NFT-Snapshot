# NFT-Snapshot
Script that snapshots an NFT


# Usage
1. Add a .env file with Moralis Api Key
2. Set the chain and contract address in index.js
3. Run with node and enjoy

The script gathers every NFT belonging to each owner, and displays how long those NFTs have been held. This can of course be modified/extended.
